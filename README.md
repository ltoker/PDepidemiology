"AnalysisFrameScript.R" loads the general functions and packages to run the analysis and defines the results directory. Different parts of the analysis are performed by scripts located in the "ProjectScripts" folder. Each of the scripts loads and defines script-specific packages and functions

To run th analysis, source "AnalysisFrameCript.R", which runs the scripts in "ProjectScripts" folder, in the correct order.

"SessionInf.Rds" contains the information regarding the environment (operating system and versions) used to run the original analysis


Have fun :)
